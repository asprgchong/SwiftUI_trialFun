## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  I was trying to implement a user input via a textfield and updating the inputted values to the table. 
  However, I firstly did not know how to access the text value from the textfield until I looked at the 
  Swift Documentation. After a bit of coding and navigation, I figured out where the storyboard was, the 
  viewcontroller, and how to implement a very basic navigation system in the app.
